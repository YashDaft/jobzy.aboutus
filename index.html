                    <p>
                        The main purpose of our project is to reduce the irritating inconvenience that a person goes through while looking for jobs and internships browsing through different job search engines which leads to confusion and a wastage of time. Companies also miss
                        out on qualified candidates, If the HR department of a company isnâ€™t competent with the internet, it might lose out on the most valuable and well-trained candidates for the job. This loss of human capital can present massive costs
                        down the line, which will outweigh the initial savings in recruitment costs.</p>
